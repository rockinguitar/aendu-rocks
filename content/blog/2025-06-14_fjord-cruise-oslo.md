Ingunn and I went on a beautiful fjord cruise in Oslo with the electric boat **The Fjord**. We wanted to test the accessibility of this sightseeing boat. The 1.5-hour trip takes you along the city's shoreline, past famous landmarks, historical sites, and between the idyllic islands. 

To board the boat, the crew can place an extra ramp to help you get on. The boat has several floors, and they are accessible with well-designed ramps on both sides of the vessel.

We were lucky with the weather. The sun was shining, and it was comfortably warm.

## The good

- The boat is accessible and fun with a wheelchair  
- You can buy snacks and drinks
- The crew is friendly and helpful  
- There is no motor noise. You float silently through the Oslo Fjord, which is an amazing experience  

## The bad

The only downside is the steep price: 420 kr per person.
