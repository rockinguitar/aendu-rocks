The Cosmopolitan cocktail—often called simply a “Cosmo”—is one of my favorite vodka-based drinks. I think it had a major comeback around 1998 thanks to the TV show *Sex and the City*. 

At a bar in Tivoli, Copenhagen, I once learned from a bartender that the Cosmo was originally considered a **gentlemen's drink**. Despite its simple recipe, it's surprisingly hard to find a good one at bars. Especially in tourist areas, you'll often get strange versions that have little in common with the real Cosmopolitan. More often than not, I end up disappointed.

## What Makes a Great Cosmopolitan?

The most important factor is the **balance between sweet and sour**. Don't overdo it with the booze, and there's no need to add simple syrup. The best Cosmopolitan I've ever had? That one's easy—my girlfriend Ingunn makes it. I'm happy to share her **signature recipe** with you.

## Recipes

For a long time, Ingunn's recipe was my ultimate favorite. The drink tastes fantastic—and the big advantage of her version is how easy it is to remember: `4-3-2-1`.

- 4 ice cubes  
- 3 parts cranberry juice  
- 2 parts vodka  
- 1 part Cointreau  
- *(Optional: 1 dash of simple syrup)*  
- 1 quarter of a lime  

But time goes on, and I eventually tried a new version from the cocktail book *Cocktail Codex*. This recipe is slightly more advanced, but it's also more reliable thanks to its precise measurements:

- 60 ml (2 oz) citrus or plain vodka  
- 22.5 ml (¾ oz) Cointreau  
- 15 ml (½ oz) fresh lime juice  
- 15 ml (½ oz) pure, unsweetened cranberry juice  
- 15 ml (½ oz) simple syrup  
- Garnish: Lime wheel  

For both recipes, add all ingredients to a shaker filled with ice and shake well.  
Double strain into a chilled cocktail glass.

Cheers!
