The summer of 2020 was supposed to be spent with friends in Switzerland. But as the pandemic tightened its grip, international travel quickly was impossible.

Sitting at home and reading on the balcony? After months of remote work and staring at the same four walls, that didn’t feel like much of a holiday. We craved fresh air, open roads, and new scenery. So, we packed the car and went on a road trip from Oslo to Norsjø, Nevlunghavn, Spangereid (in Lindesnes), and finally Stord.

## What is Lindesnes?

Lindesnes isn’t the name of a town, but a municipality in Agder County, at the southernmost tip of mainland Norway. It’s about 400 km from Oslo, making it an easy day’s drive by car.

## Spangereid: Seaside Charm and Cold Waters

Spangereid is a beautiful coastal village with colorful flowers, sandy beaches, and cozy seaside cabins. Unfortunately, the sea was far too cold for my liking, so I skipped the swim. Instead, we enjoyed a relaxing stay at our friend Ingrid’s lovely cabin.

### The Famous Underwater Restaurant

Spangereid has gained attention in recent years thanks to *Under* – Europe’s first and largest underwater restaurant. We tried booking a table well in advance, but it was already fully booked. If you're hoping to dine there, plan several months ahead!

### Cracking Crabs in the Garden

One highlight of the trip was a crab lunch hosted by Ingrid’s parents. It was my first time cleaning crabs, and I loved the rustic tools we used – a wooden board and a handy stone. Just be careful not to crush your fingers! A crab picker is essential for getting the meat out of the legs. Clearly, I need more practice to master the technique.

## Mandal: White Houses and a Red Ball

A short drive from Spangereid lies the small town of Mandal, known for its charming white-painted wooden houses. Unfortunately, the path up to Uranienborg hill was too steep and uneven for my wheelchair, so we skipped the viewpoint.

Thankfully, the town's bakery more than made up for it with delicious pastries and excellent coffee. Down by the harbor, next to the white pedestrian bridge, we spotted a mysterious red ball floating in the water. Art installation? Navigation marker? Still no idea.

## Lindesnes Fyr – Norway’s Southernmost Lighthouse

At the very tip of Norway sits **Lindesnes fyr**, the country's oldest lighthouse. It’s a dramatic place where the land ends and the sea begins. Bunker tunnels weave beneath the rocky terrain, hinting at a storied past.

We were lucky with the weather—clear skies gave us breathtaking views over the ocean and rugged landscape. But honestly, I’d recommend visiting in any weather. Experiencing crashing waves, howling wind, and stormy skies from the cliffs must be unforgettable.
