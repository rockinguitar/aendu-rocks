In Oslo, winter lasts almost six months — cold and with just a little sunshine. No wonder we're craving warmth, sun and a pool!

I can't count how many times I've been to Gran Canaria. It's not the most exciting place, but it's one of the few islands with pleasant winter temperatures — and there's a direct flight from Oslo. This year, we travelled with our friends Fredrik and Maren and stayed at the [Lopesan Baobab Resort](https://www.lopesan.com/en/hotels/spain/gran-canaria/meloneras/baobab-resort/) in Meloneras. The hotel has excellent wheelchair-accessible rooms. The cocktails and drinks are surprisingly good, especially compared to other bars in Meloneras. We loved the heated pool next to the bar! It has flat steps to walk in, making it perfect for me to do some leg training.

Ingunn and I did some solid research to find decent places for dinner. There are many tourist traps, but we managed to discover a few gems.

## Time

[Time Maspalomas](https://www.timefoodshop.es/) is, in my opinion, the best Italian restaurant on the island. Every day they offer a special menu, which I really enjoy. You'll find fresh fish, homemade pasta, delicious pizza — everything is made in-house. If you're still hungry, don't miss the desserts. The service is excellent, and I love their wine pairings with the food. That extra care really elevates the experience. Make sure to book in advance — the place is not very large.

## La Bodega

[La Bodega](https://www.hotel-palm-beach.com/es/bares-restaurantes-maspalomas/la-bodega-tapas) is a hidden gem located inside the Palm Beach Hotel. If you're in the mood for tapas, this is the best spot. The ambiance is cosy, the service is top notch, and the food is incredibly good. You can order several dishes and share them with friends — perfect for a relaxed evening.

## El Churrasco Restaurante Grill

Love meat? Then you have to try [El Churrasco](https://www.elchurrascorestaurante.com/). They grill the meat to your liking, and you can choose from a variety of side dishes and sauces. Naturally, a glass of red wine is a must!
