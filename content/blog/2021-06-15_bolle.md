**Best "Bolle" recipe I've tried so far! ðŸ˜Š**

Tangzhong bunsâ€”also known as *Boller* in Norwegianâ€”are regular buns made extra soft and fluffy thanks to a simple flour-and-milk paste (called a roux or thickening) that's added to the dough. The result? Incredibly juicy and airy buns you'll want to make again and again.

## Ingredients

### Prep Dough (Thickening)

- 60 g flour  
- 300 g light milk  

### Main Dough

- 700 g flour  
- 150 g sugar  
- 25 g fresh yeast or 7 g dry yeast (Â½ packet)  
- 1 tsp vanilla sugar  
- Â¼ tsp salt  
- 1 egg  
- 260 g light milk  
- 110 g good-quality butter, at room temperature  
- 1 egg for brushing  
- Raisins (optional)  

## Method

### 1. Make the Prep Dough (Thickening)

Start by making the thickening. Stir together the flour and milk in a saucepan. Heat gently over medium heat, stirring constantly until the mixture thickens (no hotter than 65â€¯â„ƒ). Let it cool to room temperature.

### 2. Make the Main Dough

In a large bowl, mix together the flour, dry yeast (if using), vanilla sugar, and salt.  

In a separate bowl, combine the milk and sugar, then stir in the egg. If you're using fresh yeast, crumble it into the milk mixture and stir to dissolve.

Add the cooled thickening and milk mixture to the dry ingredients. Knead in a stand mixer on low speed for 10â€“15 minutes. If kneading by hand, try to knead for at least 15â€“20 minutes.

Cut the butter into cubes and gradually add it to the dough. Knead for another 10â€“15 minutes until smooth and elastic. Let the dough rest for 10 minutes, then shape it into one large ball (like a pizza dough ball).

Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rise until doubled in size. After rising, knead and fold the dough about 4 times. If using raisins, knead them in now.

### 3. Shape and Bake

Divide the dough into 12 equal pieces. Form into smooth buns and place them on a baking tray lined with parchment paper. The buns can rise into each otherâ€”this helps them stay extra juicy.

Let the buns rise for about 30 minutes.  
Before baking, brush the tops with beaten egg.

Bake in a preheated oven at 210â€¯â„ƒ (middle rack) for about 12 minutes. Let the buns cool on a wire rack.

## Tips

The dough is quite soft and sticky when shaping. Avoid adding flour directly to the doughâ€”just dust your hands lightly with flour if needed when forming the buns.
