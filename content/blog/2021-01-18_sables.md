Do not worry, I am going to write about the real Sablé cookie you can eat, and not the ones that are saved in a web browser. Sablé is a French round shortbread cookie. Its origin goes way back to 1670. According to Wikipedia, it was created for the first time in Sablé-sur-Sarthe, a commune in France.

Why is Sablé my favorite Christmas cookie? Because of the buttery taste and the crunchy, sandy consistency when you bite into a Sablé. I really get addicted to Sablés. That is why I must bake them for every Christmas season. Every time I bake Sablés, I get a flashback to my childhood. I am glad that I wrote down my grandmother’s recipe.

How do you bake Sablés? The recipe is quite easy. All you need is butter, sugar, flour, vanilla sugar, and a little bit of salt.

## Ingredients for 80 Sablés

- 350 g butter
- 500 g flour
- 150 – 200 g sugar
- 8 g vanilla sugar
- a pinch of salt

## Instructions

Do not forget to take the butter out of the fridge well before you start! The butter must be incredibly soft. 

Start by mixing the sugar together with the butter. You want to get a frothy consistency! Add the vanilla sugar and salt. Mix everything for 15 minutes! 

Finally, add the flour and work everything together into a dough. Cover the dough and let it rest for an hour. 

After resting, roll two sausages out of the dough. The diameter of the roll should be approximately 4 cm. Be careful — the dough is very fragile! After you have two nice dough sausages, put them in the freezer or outside on the balcony for 30 minutes. It is much easier to cut 1 cm rounds when the dough is firmer.


## Baking

Start your oven and set the temperature to 190 °C, upper and lower heat. Put the Sablés on a baking tray with baking paper. Bake the Sablés for 10 minutes. Take care — they should not get too much color. After baking, let the Sablés rest until they are cold and hard.

Enjoy!
