My friends in Switzerland call me Aendu ‚Äî a short and sweet version of Andr√©, as the Swiss love to do. That nickname stuck with me, and so aendu.rocks was born.

These days, I call Oslo home ‚Äî a vibrant contrast to the alpine beauty of Thun, the small town in Switzerland where I grew up. Surrounded by towering mountains and nestled beside Lake Thun, it's where I started exploring the outdoors, sounds, and small creative projects.

## Passionate about life (and loud guitars)

I'm a curious soul who finds joy in concerts, photography, electric guitars, cooking, traveling, and mixing cocktails. Music isn't just a hobby ‚Äî it's the rhythm behind much of what I do. From rock and metal to jazz, film scores, and classical, I've always had a soft spot for the complexity and storytelling of progressive rock and metal.

## What I do when I'm not stirring Negronis

I've been building software professionally since October 2007 ‚Äî mostly in C# and .NET, but I'm always exploring beyond that. These days, I'm diving into Kotlin and love experimenting with new languages, frameworks, and ways of solving problems.

What excites me most is that sweet spot between deep technical focus and creative teamwork ‚Äî solving real problems with clean code and curious minds.

## A few strong opinions

I'm all for modern tech ‚Äî but voice messages in chat? Absolute nightmare. They waste time, eat data, can't be searched, and force everyone to listen instead of just quickly reading. They're often full of dead air, rambling, and ‚Äúuhms‚Äù while people think out loud. And you can't listen to them just anywhere ‚Äî especially not in noisy surroundings or public spaces. It's not communication ‚Äî it's thoughtless and annoying. Voice messages in chat are a sin. üò†

Integrity matters deeply to me ‚Äî both in work and life. Without it, trust crumbles, and nothing meaningful can really grow.

I love my life in Oslo ‚Äî it feels like home in all the right ways. Sure, the winters can be dark, cold, and a bit of a test of patience, but the city more than makes up for it with its charm, nature, and quality of life.

And while I'm usually quite chill, I have little patience for rudeness, arrogance, or plain stupidity. Kindness, politeness, and being considerate of others go a long way.

## Love brought me North

I never imagined moving to a different country ‚Äî but then I met Ingunn in Helsinki. What started as a long-distance friendship slowly turned into something much more.

A year later, we were in love. Eventually, I took the leap and moved to Norway.

Ingunn is an inspiring writer and traveler who blogs about exploring the world in a wheelchair. If you're searching for travel inspiration ‚Äî with or without wheels ‚Äî check out her fantastic blog: [Wheel the World](https://wheeltheworld.net/).
